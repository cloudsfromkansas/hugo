A couple weeks ago, I started my foray into Go programming. I thought what better way to start than to use Hugo, a Go programmed static site generator, to develop a blog and write about learning Go programming and doing software engineering. I followed The Simple Engineer’s video Creating a Blog with Hugo and Github in 10 minutes and instead of spending 10 minutes, I spent about 10 hours working with Hugo server, GitHub pages, its DNS, finicky Git submodules and a fruitless foray into git worktrees. Something taking 10 minutes actually taking 10 hours is pretty much the M.O. for my personal projects. Totally worth it though. 

I now have a source repo called hugo where content and Hugo resides and a GitHub pages repo which hosts the generated public content that you see here. The hardest part was picking a theme. I went through a dozen but found the PaperMod theme quite fitting. The original Paper theme is good but this is great. Good job to both authors. After I find a theme, I try to find how others have used it. I do that by doing a simple Google search of the footer “Powered by Hugo · Theme PaperMod”. I found some good examples, specifically a Kubernetes expert Chris Short using the theme at his blog, chrisshort.net. Who I might have watched when I was working on a Red Hat OpenShift deployment. 

I hope to use this blog to share what I’ve learned and keep me committed. I have a lot of projects I want to work on and a lot of things I want to learn. I have ideas ranging from software engineering in a professional setting to ideas about augmented reality apps, crypto apps and other small SaaS solutions. Feel free to reach out to me at bluekansas@protonmail.com, add me on LinkedIn/dataryan or code with me on GitHub/gokansas.
