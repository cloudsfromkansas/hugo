I’m a software engineer from Kansas. I've lived in Africa and South America but I now happily reside in good ol' Kansas City. I’ve worked for small startups to large enterprises. Before I kicked off my professional software engineering career 6 years ago, I had been a freelance web developer and system administrator. If you’re interested in what I’ve done professionally, please add me on LinkedIn, https://www.linkedin.com/in/dataryan/. I’ve worked with a large swath of technologies on premise and in AWS.

I’m professionally focusing on backend and devops engineering with Go, data engineering with Python, Kubernetes, AWS and GCP. I’m working on a couple personal projects, mainly my homelab. Hopefully, this blog will help me organize my projects and keep me committed to learning. I have ideas for augmented reality apps, cryptocurrency wallets and small SaaS solutions that I hope I can start to materialize.

If you have some ideas or you want to chat feel free to reach out to me at bluekansas@protonmail.com.
